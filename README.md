[![Build status](https://gitlab.com/congma/takeevery/badges/master/build.svg)](https://gitlab.com/congma/takeevery/commits/master)

The module provides a Python generator, `every(iterable, n)` that yields lists
of size at most `n` from `iterable`, until the iterable is exhausted.

More examples can be found in the docstrings.

This module uses the Python 2-to-3 compatibility layer
[`six`](https://pythonhosted.org/six/).
